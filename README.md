- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/): Auth0 is an easy to implement, adaptable authentication and authorization platform. Secure access for everyone. But not just anyone.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development - desktop and cloud. Dockerâ€™s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/): Docker Compose relies on Docker Engine for any meaningful work, so make sure you have Docker Engine installed either locally or remote, depending on your setup.
